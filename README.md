# Random-Forest-Classification
A complete guide to machine learning model Random Forest Classification

Introduction
Machine learning has indeed changed the approach and process of solving many problems across industries, such as disease predictability, fraud transaction identification, and product recommendation, among others. Behind many of these innovations is a type of powerful algorithm called the Random Forest. Its simplicity but robustness will yield more powerful models (Liaw and Wiener, 2002).
Random Forest is one of the ensemble learning algorithms, specifically designed for both classification and regression tasks. It builds on the weak points of a single decision tree, which tends to overfit the data by combining the predictions of many decision trees to make the final prediction (Python Libraries Documentation, n.d.). This ensures better generalization and improved model stability.
Why use Random Forest?
There are several reasons why Random Forest stands out:
Robustness: It helps reduce overfitting, as it averages the results of many trees and will thus have a better chance of generalizing to the unseen data.
Versatile: It works very well with numeric, categorical, and even mixed data types.
Feature Importance: It can rank features by their importance for the predictions, providing a view into the dataset.
Accuracy: It attains excellent classification and regression performances if properly tuned.

2. Random Forest: Overview
Random Forest is a popular ensemble learning technique intended for classification and regression applications (Liaw and Wiener, 2002). It works by generating many decision trees during the training process and using them to make final predictions based on their output. The approach is an ensemble, thus enhancing the ability of the model to generalize better compared to a single decision tree (Chen and Zhang, 2018).
Basically, Random Forest makes use of the technique bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, wherein each decision tree is fit on a random subset of the data set with replacement. Further, for any split within a decision tree, only a random subset of the features is evaluated. The techniques thus engender diversity among the trees and lower correlation, increasing the stability and accuracy of the model.
 
Major Features
•	Non-Linear Modeling:
Random Forest can learn complex relationships between features and the target variable, including when the data follows some non-linear patterns.
•	Feature Importance:
The algorithm rank-orders the importance of each feature in the dataset, helping understand which features contribute most to predictions. This makes it a useful tool for feature selection and the understanding of the dataset.
•	Robust to Noise:
The ensemble approach helps Random Forest deal with noisy data and irrelevant features by spreading the influence of outliers over many trees.
•	Deals with Imbalance:
It can perform well on imbalanced datasets where one class has far more instances than the others by adjusting the class weights.
•	Generalization:
Random Forest avoids overfitting due to the average of multiple outputs by the trees and gives a good performance on the test data.

3. Dataset Description
We use a synthetic dataset in this tutorial, which is designed to mimic real-world challenges often encountered in machine learning projects. The dataset contains 10 numerical features (feature_1 through feature_10) and a binary target variable (target), which makes it suitable for classification tasks (UCI Machine Learning Repository, n.d.).
Dataset Characteristics
Number of Samples: 1000
Number of Features: 10 numerical variables
Target Variable Distribution:
Class 0: 896 samples (majority class)
Class 1: 104 samples (minority class)
The dataset is slightly imbalanced, with Class 0 having a significantly larger number of instances than Class 1. This imbalance may lead to biased models, as the model will favor predicting the majority class. Techniques such as adjusting class weights or oversampling minority classes (such as SMOTE) can be used to improve performance.
Key Steps for Dataset Preparation
Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded using pandas, which allows for flexible manipulation and analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Checked for missing values, data types, and distributions of features and the target variable.
Verified the balance of class distributions to identify any potential challenges for the model.

 
 

4. Methodology
Random Forest Classification follows these steps:
4.1. Loading and Exploratory Analysis of Data
Inspect the dataset for: 
Missing values (treat them appropriately if they exist).
Class distribution to know if the data is imbalanced.
Statistical summary of feature properties using describe().

4.2. Data Split
Divide the dataset into:
Training Set (80%): For training the model.
Testing Set (20%): To test how good the model is on new data.

4.3. Hyperparameter Tuning
There are some parameters in Random Forest which have a great influence on its performance:
n_estimators: Number of decision trees in the forest.
max_depth: The maximum depth of an individual tree.
min_samples_split: Number of samples required in every node to split the nodes.
criterion: The criterion for best quality split (gini or entropy).

4.4. Model Building
The optimized model from Random Forest is built using the training dataset. In the fitting phase:
Bootstrapping technique is used to draw the examples at random.
A subset of features is used in the decision for each split. This will ensure there is variety among the trees (Smith, 2015).

4.5. Evaluation
Confusion Matrix: True positive, true negative, false positives, false negatives
Classification Report: precision, recall, and F1-score
ROC Curve: this measures the classifier ability to distinguish between classes.

4.6. Feature Importance Analysis
Random forest helps show the importance of the feature. It is very important since:
Understanding which variables influence prediction the most.
Simplifying models by removing irrelevant features (Fernández et al., 2018).

5. Hyperparameter Optimization Results
Hyperparameter tuning is an important training step for a machine learning model, as it enables the model to perform best by finding the best parameter combination. For this tutorial, we used GridSearchCV to search systematically for the best combination by evaluating multiple combinations using cross-validation (UCI Machine Learning Repository, n.d.).
After running GridSearchCV, the following parameters emerged as optimal for the Random Forest classifier:
n_estimators: 50
This number of decision trees in a forest. The fewer are to be computed, the accuracy kept being much.
max_depth = 10
This is the number of maximum depth for all of your decision trees. This may not be too shallow either (underfitting), nor too deep (overfitting).
min_samples_split = 10
This is the minimum no of samples required to split a node. Higher values prevent overfitting by enforcing more data at splits.
min_samples_leaf = 1
The minimum no. of samples required to come at a leaf node. So, the tree branches do not split too much on small subsets of data
criterion: 'entropy'
Function to measure the quality of a split. 'Entropy' ensures splits provide most information gain.

Efficiency: It reduces computation time through the avoidance of large trees or multiple trees in the forest.

 


6. Model Performance
6.1. Accuracy
The Random Forest model had an accuracy of 94% on the test set. Such high accuracy reveals that the model can get most of the samples correctly predicted. However, accuracy alone is insufficient for imbalanced datasets because it can conceal performance on the minority class (Scikit-learn, n.d.).

6.2. Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix - the breakdown of the model's predictions is detailed as follows:
Class 0 (Majority Class):
This is 100% accuracy and recall, meaning the actual Class 0 samples were correctly identified with no false positives or false negatives.
Class 1 (Minority Class):
There was some misclassification. Of the 21 actual Class 1 samples, 11 were classified as Class 0.
 

6.3. Classification Report
Precision: It measures how many predicted positives were actual positives.
Class 0: 94%
Class 1: 100%
Recall: It measures how many actual positives were correctly identified.
Class 0: 100%
Class 1: 48%
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, indicating overall performance for each class.
Class 0: 97%
Class 1: 65%
Macro average is the unweighted mean of the metrics across both classes, while the weighted average accounts for the class imbalance.
 

6.4. ROC Curve
It showed the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve in graphical form as to distinguish between classes, the ability of the model. AUC was 0.99, which showed excellent separability.
Interpretation
AUC = 1.0: Strong classification.
AUC = 0.5: Random guess.
AUC = 0.99: Suggests that the model is very good at distinguishing between the two classes.
 
7. Feature Importance Analysis
Random Forest gives a special advantage in being able to measure the importance of each feature in contributing to the model's predictions. Feature importance is calculated as the decrease in impurity across all decision trees in the forest every time a specific feature is used for a split.
Top Contributing Features:
Feature 5: This was the most important feature of all, indicating it had the largest predictive power for distinguishing between classes.
Feature 1: The second most important of all, showing strong relevance to the target variable.
Feature 10: Contributed moderately to the model predictions, making it a valuable yet less dominant feature.
Less Important Features:
There seem to be least important feature contributants like Feature 3, Feature 8 and Feature 9 which possibly do not have very effective powers on the model outputs such that in future editions those features could be neglected by leaving them out to de-bloated the model and boost efficiency computations.
 
8. Insights and Recommendations
Performance:
The Random Forest classifier delivered outstanding performance for this set of data with 94% accuracy and an AUC of 0.99.
However, the class that is a minority exhibited misclassifications, as it is clear that the classifier fails to classify the model with imbalanced data very well.
Feature Analysis
Feature importance analysis revealed the most influential Feature 5 followed by Feature 1 and Feature 10. Thus, these features contribute positively to the model's predictive capabilities (UCI Machine Learning Repository, n.d.).
Features like Feature 3, Feature 8, and Feature 9 had minimal contribution and might be candidates for removal in future iterations.
Robustness
The bagging approach by Random Forest makes it noise-robust and prevents overfitting. This is especially helpful in datasets that have irrelevant or noisy features.

Recommendations
Balance Class
Improve the recall of the minority class, Class 1. Techniques that can be applied are
Oversampling: Apply SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for balancing the dataset.
Class Weighting: Increase the weights on the minority class during the training process of the model so that the misclassification is heavily penalized.
Feature Selection:
Reduce the number of features and remove low importance features, for example, Feature 3, Feature 8, and Feature 9. This decreases noise and computation but will not heavily impact the performance.
